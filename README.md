## Encryption and Shortening Code - README

This demonstration showcases a simplified encryption and shortening process implemented in Python. The code `encrypt_and_shorten_code` employs multiple rounds of reverse computing and SHA-256 hashing to encrypt and shorten a provided code string.

### Methodology:
1. **Original Code Encryption**:
   The original code undergoes multiple rounds of reverse computing, where each '0' bit is transformed into '1' and vice versa.
   
2. **Salting**:
   To enhance security and complexity, a random salt of 16 characters is generated and appended to the original code before encryption.
   
3. **Hashing**:
   The encrypted code, including the salt, is then hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm to produce a shortened version of the code.

### Security Measures:
- The demonstration avoids the use of any sensitive data, ensuring the safety and confidentiality of information.
- The random salt adds an extra layer of complexity to the encryption process, further bolstering security.

### Implementation:
The function `encrypt_and_shorten_code` takes the original code and the number of rounds for reverse computing as input. The output includes the salted code and the shortened encrypted code.

### Example Usage:
```python
original_code = "SampleSecurityCode123"
rounds = 5
salted_code, encrypted_and_shortened_code = encrypt_and_shorten_code(original_code, rounds)

print("Original Security Code:", original_code)
print("Salted Code:", salted_code)
print("Encrypted and Shortened Code:", encrypted_and_shortened_code)
```

### Note:
This demonstration is for educational and illustrative purposes. The encryption process and salting method can be customized for specific security requirements in real-world applications
